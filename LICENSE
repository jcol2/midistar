All subfolders and files that are NOT in the 'external' folder are considered

2. THIRD-PARTY LICENSES
midistar uses third-party libraries that are NOT considered to be part of the
midistar project, but are distributed with the midistar source for ease-of-
access and completeness. Each subfolder in the 'external' folder contains a
different third-party library that is used by midistar.

These libraries are licensed under their own terms and ARE NOT subject to the
terms of the 'GPLv3' file in the root directory of the midistar project. For
licensing information about a specific third-party library, refer to the
'LICENSE' and/or 'README' file in the folder that contains the library.

See the midistar 'README' file for a list of third-party libraries that
midistar uses, and their copyright holders. Each third-party library remains
unmodified.
